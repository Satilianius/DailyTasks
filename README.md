# Daily Tasks

Daily tasks is an application, which allows to create some tasks for yourself and log the progress.

The basic functionality would just show the progress using web or mobile UI on pages like week, month, year progress.

|                | M      | T      | W      | T      | F | S | S |
|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---|---|---|
| "water plants" | done   | done   | done   | -      | - | - | - |
| "read book"    | 15 p   | 32 p   | 16 p   | 25 p   | - | - | - |
| "run"          | 30 min | 35 min | 40 min | 35 min | - | - | - |
| "go to bed"    | 1:30   | 1:40   | 1:00   | 0:55   | - | - | - |

In the future, I am planning to add some statistics to the data.
