# Project Guidelines

* Build the project which was updated before submitting results
* Avoid suppressing warnings, try to resolve them instead
* Avoid unnecessary verbosity in comments
* When running tests prefer running several in one command, not one by one
* When creating strings containing JSON, annotate the line with `// language=json` for IDE support
* Write unit tests where it is sensible to test the functionality
* Follow the TDD approach: first create a test which fails, then change the code to make the test pass
